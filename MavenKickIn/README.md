<h3>Summary: </h3>
The Kick-In Document Tool was made for the Kick-In committee as the project for module 7.  
The tool provides a portal for different users to look at the emails sent by the Kick-In
committee, and the documents attached to those emails. The access to those
documents can be regulated by the administrators of the app, by grouping users in 
custom groups, and deciding per document which group of users can access the 
document.
<h3>Functionalities:</h3>
